# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
1. It was very challenging and extremely rewarding to diagnose the issues in my code. I got discourage a few times (like right now I'm taking a break from the final challenge on Oop.js).
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
2. I still need to work on taking breaks rather than just slamming my head into a wall when I get stuck on something. I have a bad habit of not giving up
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
3. I need someone to remind me to get away from my computer for a while. I need to remember to get enough sleep, stick to my bedtime and eat right. I think getting more used to working on a calendar will help me out a lot. I need to make sure I don't forget to schedule meals and breaks.
